# Hawk-Dove
The Hawk-Dove game is classic model of conflict in game theory with applications in evolutionary biology. 
It simulates an ecosystem of passive and aggressive birds, with the addition of environmental restraints.
The code is set to model the behavior, reproduction and death of hawks and doves, represented by objects, as they evolve over time. I used the tkinter module to plot speciation that occurs due to defensive strategy, modeled by 'encounters,' as a proxy for animal territoriality.

## Game Theory
The phenomena that this project simulates is a version of the popular economics game of chicken (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)). It was introduced by John Maynard Smith and George Price in a 1973 paper, “The logic of animal conflict.” 


This code was submitted as a part of an object-oriented programming assignment for CSCI 121. Since the course is an introduction to Python programming, the code may contain errors.
